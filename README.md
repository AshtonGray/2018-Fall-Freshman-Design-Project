# Fall-2018-Freshman-Design-Project

This project was a demonstration of a projectile motion physics simulation.
A potentiometer was used with a servo to rotate the firing mechanism. With how far the potentiometer was turned, the angle of the servo could be calculated, as well as where the object would land
